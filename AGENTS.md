# Project Context: S25-Lab-Listener
This project is a high-performance, headless AI transcription agent for the **Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra**.

## 🛑 Supervisor/Reviewer Rules (Strict Enforcement)
As the Gemini Agent, you are the **Lead Reviewer**. Your job is to audit code generated by external CLI tools.
1. **Hardware Reality:** The target device is the **Samsung S25 Ultra** (Snapdragon 8 Elite). All TFLite implementation MUST use the **NNAPI** or **GPU Delegate**. CPU inference is unacceptable.
2. **OS Constraints:** Target SDK is **36** (Android 16).
   - **Foreground Services:** You must strictly enforce `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` permissions. If the manifest is missing the `foregroundServiceType`, flag it immediately.
   - **Permissions:** Runtime permissions for Audio and Notifications are mandatory.
3. **Architecture:**
   - **Headless:** The app has no main UI flow. It is a Service-first architecture.
   - **Network:** Data is streamed via WebSockets to `ws://192.168.x.x`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Language:** Kotlin (Strictly use Coroutines for async).
- **ML:** TensorFlow Lite (`org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu`).
- **Net:** OkHttp (`okhttp3`).
- **Build:** Gradle Kotlin DSL.

## 🚨 Common Hallucinations to Watch For
- **Do NOT** allow the use of `IntentService` (Deprecated).
- **Do NOT** allow raw thread management; force `Dispatchers.IO`.
- **Verify Model Loading:** Ensure models are loaded from `assets/` and mapped correctly to the NPU delegate.
